This script implements Model 3 for MongoDB document design.
In Model 3, each company document embeds an array of person documents in a 'staff' field.

Pipeline Steps Implemented in this File:
Step 1: Clear previous data from the target collection (`clear_collections`)
Step 2: Insert company and employee data following the Model 3 schema (`insert_data`)
Step 3: Run and time the required queries:
    - Q1: For each person, retrieve their full name and their companyâ€™s name
    - Q2: For each company, retrieve its name and the number of employees
    - Q3: Update the age of each person born before 1988 to 30
    - Q4: Update each company's name to include the word "Company"
