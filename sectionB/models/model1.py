"""
This script implements Model 1 for MongoDB data modeling.
In Model 1, `persons` and `companies` are stored in separate collections,
and relationships are maintained using foreign key references (companyId).

Pipeline Steps Implemented in this File:
Step 1: Clear previous data from collections (`clear_collections`)
Step 2: Insert person and company data with reference IDs (`insert_data`)
Step 3: Run and time the required queries:
    - Q1: For each person, retrieve their full name and their companyâ€™s name using a join
    - Q2: Count number of employees per company
    - Q3: Set age = 30 for all persons born before 1988
    - Q4: Append the word "Company" to all company names
