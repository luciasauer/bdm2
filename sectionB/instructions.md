# Section B: Implementation Instructions

1. Before running `main.py`, ensure to have MongoDB service running. 
2. Located in the root directory of the repository, create a virtual environment by running `uv sync` ([check uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)).
3. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Execute the `main.py`
    ```bash
    $ python main.py

    Generating datasets...

    Running Model1...
    query1 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query2 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query3 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query4 executed in xxxxxx seconds

    Running Model2...
    query1 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query2 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query3 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query4 executed in xxxxxx seconds

    Running Model3...
    query1 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query2 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query3 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    query4 executed in xxxxxx seconds
    ```

The code will execute the steps described in section 1, 2 and 3.

## 1. üèóÔ∏è Data Generation

We use the [`Faker`](https://faker.readthedocs.io/) Python library to simulate random companies and employees. To ensure a fair comparison across the three data models, the **same dataset** is used consistently throughout all models.

## 2. üíæ Data Insertion and Query Execution

Each data model is implemented in its own dedicated module:

* `model1.py`
* `model2.py`
* `model3.py`

These modules are responsible for:

* Structuring and inserting data into MongoDB using the respective model design.
* Defining and executing the required queries (Q1 to Q4).

To maintain clean and modular code, data generation logic is separated into `data_generator.py`, while reusable utilities (e.g., timing decorators) are housed in `utils.py`.

## 3. ‚è±Ô∏è Query Timing

We measure the execution time of each query using the `timed_query` decorator defined in `utils.py`. This decorator is applied to each query function and automatically logs the time taken for query execution.

Example usage:

```python
@timed_query
def query_1():
    # MongoDB query logic
```

This ensures consistent and minimal-intrusion benchmarking of all queries across all models.

## 4. üìÅ Project Structure

```bash
project/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py               # Orchestrates data generation, insertion, and querying
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_generator.py     # Responsible for generating company and person data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/               # Contains one file per data model
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model1.py         # Reference-based model
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model2.py         # Embedded company inside person
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ model3.py         # Embedded persons inside company
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py              # Shared utilities (e.g., timing decorators)
```

## 5. Summary of Model Trade-Offs

| Model        | Characteristics                      | Pros                                    | Cons                                        |
| -----------  | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **M1**  | Separate collections with references | Flexible updates, normalized structure  | Requires joins/aggregation for related data |
| **M2**  | Company embedded in each person      | Faster reads for person-centric queries | Redundant company data across persons       |
| **M3**  | Persons embedded in each company     | Efficient company-centric queries       | Difficult to update individual person info  |
